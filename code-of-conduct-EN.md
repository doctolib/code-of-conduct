## Purpose
A primary goal of this Code of Conduct is to be inclusive to the largest number of people, with the most varied and diverse backgrounds possible. As such, we are committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, ability, ethnicity, socioeconomic status and religion (or lack thereof).

This Code of Conduct outlines our expectations for all those who participate in our opened to public events, as well as the consequences for unacceptable behavior.

## Scope
This code and related procedures apply to unacceptable behavior occurring in all Doctolib developer events that is shared with members of the public, including behavior outside the scope of events — online and in-person— as well as in all one-on-one communications, and anywhere such behavior has the potential to adversely affect the safety and well-being of participants. 

More precisely, we expect all meetups participants, sponsors, and other guests to abide by this Code of Conduct.

## Expected Behavior
The following behaviors are expected and requested of all developers, contributors and events participants:
* Be welcoming - We strive to be a community that welcomes and supports people of all backgrounds and identities
* Be kind and courteous. There’s no need to be mean or rude
* Be respectful - Exercise consideration and respect in your speech and actions.
* Participate in an authentic and active way. In doing so, you contribute to the health and longevity of the community.
* Attempt collaboration before conflict.
* Don’t provide unstructured critique. Please read and apply the recommendations in [this guide about delivering proper feedback](additional/delivering-proper-feedback.md).
* Respect that people have differences of opinion and that every design or implementation choice carries a trade-off and numerous costs. There is seldom a right answer.
* Be mindful of your surroundings and of your fellow participants. Alert community leaders if you notice a dangerous situation, someone in distress, or violations of this Code of Conduct, even if they seem inconsequential. 


## Unacceptable behavior

The following behaviors are considered harassment and are unacceptable:
* Conduct or speech which might be considered sexist, racist, homophobic, transphobic, ableist or otherwise discriminatory or offensive in nature.

* Intimidation online or in-person
* Disrespect towards differences of opinion.
* Not understanding the differences between constructive criticism and disparagement.
* Unsolicited  disruption of community events, including talks and presentations.
* Inappropriate attention or contact. Be aware of how your actions affect others. If it makes someone uncomfortable, stop. You should have someone’s consent before touching them
* Violence, threats of violence or violent language.

## Enforcement - Consequences of unacceptable behavior
Unacceptable behavior from any community member, including sponsors and those with decision-making authority, will not be tolerated.

Anyone asked to stop unacceptable behavior is expected to comply immediately.

If a community activity participant engages in unacceptable behavior, the organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, up to and including a temporary ban or permanent expulsion from the event without warning (and without refund in the case of a paid event).
